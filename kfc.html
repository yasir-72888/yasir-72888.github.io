                <div class="a1"> <p> Colonel Harland David Sanders[a] (September 9, 1890  December 16, 1980) was an American businessman, best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (also known as KFC) and later acting as the company's brand ambassador and symbol. His name and image are still symbols of the company. The title "colonel" is an honorific title, the highest awarded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky , the Kentucky Colonel, and is not a military rank. The Governor of Kentucky bestows the honor of a colonel's commission, by issuance of letters patent. Sanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as steam engine stoker, insurance salesman, and filling station operator. He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in North Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. During that time, Sanders developed his "secret recipe"and his patented method of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer.  </p></div>

                            Harland David Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in a four-room house located 3 miles (5 km) east of Henryville, Indiana.[1] He was the oldest of three children born to Wilbur David and Margaret Ann (n√©e Dunlevy) Sanders. [1] His mother was of Irish and Dutch descent.[2] The family attended the Advent Christian Church. [3] His father was a mild and affectionate man who worked his 80-acre farm, until he broke his leg in a fall. He then worked as a butcher in Henryville for two years. Sanders' mother was a devout Christian and strict parent, continuously warning her children of "the evils of alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and whistling on Sundays."[4] Sanders' father died in 1895.

                            In 1952, Sanders franchised his secret recipe "Kentucky Fried Chicken" for the first time, to Pete Harman of South Salt Lake, Utah, the operator of one of that city's largest restaurants. [26] In the first year of selling the product, restaurant sales more than tripled, with 75% of the increase coming from sales of fried chicken. [27] For Harman, the addition of fried chicken was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; in Utah, a product hailing from Kentucky was unique and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality. Don Anderson , a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name Kentucky Fried Chicken. [28] After Harman's success, several other restaurant owners franchised the concept and paid Sanders $0.04 per Chicken.

                            After being recommissioned as a Kentucky colonel in 1950 by Governor Lawrence Wetherby, Sanders began to dress the part, growing a goatee and wearing a black frock coat (later switching to a white suit), a string tie, and referring to himself as "Colonel". [25] His associates went along with the title change, "jokingly at first and then in earnest", according to biographer Josh Ozersky.[29] He never wore anything else in public during the last 20 years of his life, using a heavy wool suit in the winter and a light cotton suit in the summer. [29] He bleached his mustache and goatee to match his white hair.[24]

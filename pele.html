                    <p> (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛtsõ (w)ɐˈɾɐ̃tʃiz du nɐsiˈmẽtu]; born 23 October 1940),
                        known as Pelé (Portuguese pronunciation: [peˈlɛ]), is a Brazilian former professional footballer who
                        played as a forward.
                        Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and labelled "the greatest" by FIFA,
                        [1] he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. In 1999 he was
                        named Athlete of the Century
                        by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important
                        people of the 20th century.
                        In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football
                        History & Statistics (IFFHS),
                        and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363
                        games
                        , which included friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record.[2]

                    <p>Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international
                        career,
                        he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so.
                        Pelé is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games.
                        At club level he is Santos' all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals from 659 games.
                        [3] In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores,
                        and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup.
                        Credited with connecting the phrase "The Beautiful Game" with football,
                        Pelé's "electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals" made him a star around the world,
                        and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity.[4] During
                        his playing days,
                        Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. Since retiring in 1977
                        , Pelé has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial
                        ventures.
                        In 2010, he was named the Honorary President of the New York Cosmos.
    
                        Averaging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pelé was adept at striking the ball with
                        either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents' movements on the field. While predominantly a
                        striker, he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision
                        and passing ability, and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he
                        is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of
                        policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. His emergence at the 1958 World Cup where
                        he became the first black global sporting star was a source of inspiration.[5] Throughout his career
                        and in his retirement, Pelé received several individual and team awards for his performance in the
                        field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport.

                        Among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century,
                        [112] Pelé is one of the most lauded players in the history of football and has been frequently
                        ranked the best player ever.
                        [1][113][114] Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated;
                        "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic.
                        "[27] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined;
                        "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment.
                        He had an extraordinary perception of the game."[27] Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World
                        Cup;
                        "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat.
                        You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé.
                        "[27] His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed;
                        "In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him.
                        In others they even kissed the ground he walked on.
                        I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful."[27] </p>

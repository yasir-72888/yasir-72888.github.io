                            Fimmel was born near Echuca, Victoria, Australia. He was raised on a 5,500-acre dairy farm in Lockington. The youngest of three brothers,
                             he is the son of Jennie, a recreation officer for the disabled, 
                             and Chris, a cattle farmer.[3] Aspiring to be a professional Australian rules
                              footballer, Fimmel moved to Melbourne to play for the St Kilda Football Club in the AFL,
                               but a broken leg sidelined him before the season began.[4][5] He was accepted into RMIT 
                               to study commercial architecture and engineering but later deferred to travel abroad.[6][7]
                               Fimmel's modelling career began when he was spotted working out at a gym in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn by the 
                               flatmate of Matthew Anderson, a talent scout for the Chadwick Models agency.[8]
                               Fimmel headed to the United States and was signed on the spot with agency LA Models in 2002 after walking into 
                               their office broke and barefoot.[9] Cast by Jennifer Starr, he became the first male in the world to secure a six-figure 
                               deal to model exclusively for Calvin Klein for a year, and the last to be personally contracted by the brand's eponymous 
                               designer.[10][11] He fronted CK's Crave men's fragrance campaign and modelled the brand's famous underwear. It was reported 
                               that one of his London billboards had to be pulled down after complaints from an auto club of traffic congestion and accidents
                                by 'rubbernecking' female drivers, but Fimmel insisted the story started with a rumour spread on the internet.[12][13]
                                He was named one of the world's sexiest bachelors by America's People magazine in 2002 and at the time was regarded as "the 
                                most in-demand male model in the world".[14][15]

                                Ragnar "Lothbrok" Sigurdsson (Old Norse: Ragnarr Loðbrók, Ragnar means "keeper of the fort" and 
                                Lothbrok means "shaggy breeches") is a Viking farmer and warrior who yearns to raid the rumored 
                                riches of undiscovered England. His first wife is Lagertha, and they have two children named Gyda
                                 and Bjorn. His second wife is Aslaug, and they have four sons named Ubbe, Hvitserk, Sigurd, and 
                                 Ivar. Ragnar is the younger brother of Rollo. He becomes King of Kattegat.
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                                According to the Seer, Ragnar was born and raised in the lands near Kattegat, in southern Norway, and 
                                earned a reputation as a clever boy. When Ragnar was fifteen, King Froh of Svealand invaded Norway and
                                 killed the Norwegian King Siward. Ragnar joined with Siward-loyalists to drive out Froh. King Froh was 
                                 famous for carrying tame serpents around his neck in battle who would bite his enemies while he fought 
                                 them. For the purpose of fighting Froh, Ragnar fashioned a coat and breeches from a hairy animal hide. 
                                 In the battle that followed, Ragnar faced off with Froh and the serpents could not bite through the hide
                                  because of all the hair. Thus, Ragnar earned his name "Lothbrok," which means "the hairy-breeches."
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                                At one point, Ragnar went to Lagertha's home to confess his love to her, but he was set upon by a bear and an 
                                enormous hound who guarded her home. Ragnar killed the bear with his spear and strangled the hound with his bare
                                 hands, thus gaining Lagertha's hand in marriage. The Seer had prophesied that Ragnar will have many sons. Bjorn 
                                 is the first of these.

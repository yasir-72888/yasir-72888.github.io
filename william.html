            <h2 class="tit">Early Life</h2>

            <div class="para"> Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover
                (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent
                landowning family. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date
                of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which can
                be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare
                died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[18]
            </div>
            <div class="para"> Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that
                Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in
                1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the
                Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was
                standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based
                upon Latin classical authors.

            </div>
            <div class="para"> At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of
                the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's
                neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have
                been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once
                instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter,
                Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later
                and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11
                August 1596.

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of
                the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the "complaints bill"
                of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October
                1589. Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years". Biographers
                attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe,
                Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London
                to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is also
                supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. Another
                18th-century story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons
                in London. John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. Some 20th-century
                scholars suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of
                Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain "William Shakeshafte" in his will. Little evidence
                substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and Shakeshafte was a common
                name in the Lancashire area.
            </div>
            <h2 class="tit" London and theatrical career></h2>
            <div class="para"> It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions
                and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then, he
                was sufficiently known in London to be attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his
                Groats-Worth of Wit:

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a
                Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an
                absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words, but most agree that Greene was accusing
                Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as
                Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called "University Wits"). The italicised
                phrase parodying the line "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from Shakespeare's Henry VI,
                Part 3, along with the pun "Shake-scene", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here,
                Johannes Factotum ("Jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others,
                rather than the more common "universal genius"
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers
                suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks.
                After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a
                group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London. After
                the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I,
                and changed its name to the King's Men.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River
                Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor
                theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his
                association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in
                Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford
            </div>
            <div class="para"> Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by
                1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages. Shakespeare continued
                to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's
                Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603). The
                absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign
                that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one
                of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although
                one cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that "good
                Will" played "kingly" roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of
                Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in
                Henry V, though scholars doubt the sources of that information

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year
                before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St.
                Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the
                same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river
                again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a
                French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other headgea
            </div>
            <h2 class="tit">Later years and death</h2>
            <div class="para">
                Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to
                Stratford "some years before his death". He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an
                answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the
                Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men "placed men players" there, "which were
                Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.". However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in
                London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of
                the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was
                often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. Shakespeare continued to visit
                London during the years 1611–1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v Mountjoy, a court
                case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary. In March 1613, he bought a
                gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks
                with his son-in-law, John Hall. After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to
                him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, who succeeded him
                as the house playwright of the King's Men. He retired in 1613, before the Globe Theatre burned down
                during the performance of Henry VIII on 29 June
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will, a
                document which he begins by describing himself as being in "perfect health". No extant contemporary
                source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in
                his notebook: "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard,
                for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew
                Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: "We
                wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and
                Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare signed
                his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was
                found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth.
                Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and
                embarrassment for the Shakespeare family
            </div>
            <div class="para"> Shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna under
                stipulations that she pass it down intact to "the first son of her body".[88] The Quineys had three
                children, all of whom died without marrying.The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but
                died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line. Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions
                his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. He did make a point,
                however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars
                see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been
                the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.

            <div class="para">
                Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree
                Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                The first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the
                early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely,
                however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the
                Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first
                histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England,
                Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been
                interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by
                the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the
                traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on
                classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a
                separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona,
                in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent
                spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences
            </div>
            <div class="para"> shakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and
                precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed
                comedies. A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife
                scenes. Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the
                vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to
                modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing,[125] the charming rural setting of As
                You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great
                comedies.[126] After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced
                prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and Henry V. His characters
                become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry,
                and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.[127][128][129] This period begins and ends with
                two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and
                death;[130][131] and Julius Caesar—based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel
                Lives—which introduced a new kind of drama. According to Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius
                Caesar, "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's
                own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other"

            </div>
            <div class="para"> In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called "problem plays" Measure for
                Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies
                Many critics believe that Shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art. The titular
                hero of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, Hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other
                Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins "To be or not to be; that is
                the question". Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the
                tragedies that followed, Othello and King Lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement. The plots of
                Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the
                hero and those he loves. In Othello, the villain Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point
                where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of
                giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of
                Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode,
                "the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty". In
                Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites
                Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own
                guilt destroys them in turn. In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic
                structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's
                finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot.

                In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays:
                Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre.
                Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but
                they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have
                seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may
                merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving
                plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher

                It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594
                edition of Titus Andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.[155] After
                the plagues of 1592–93, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the
                Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of Henry IV,
                Leonard Digges recording, "Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a
                room". When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down
                and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on
                the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with Julius Caesar one of
                the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe,
                including Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear.

            <div class="para"> After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a
                special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's
                Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605,
                including two performances of The Merchant of Venice. After 1608, they performed at the indoor
                Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with
                the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage
                devices. In Cymbeline, for example, Jupiter descends "in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle:
                he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."

            <div class="para"> In 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two of Shakespeare's friends from the King's
                Men, published the First Folio, a collected edition of Shakespeare's plays. It contained 36 texts,
                including 18 printed for the first time. Many of the plays had already appeared in quarto
                versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves. No evidence suggests
                that Shakespeare approved these editions, which the First Folio describes as "stol'n and surreptitious
                copies".[172] Nor did Shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works
                likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create
                and publish the First Folio.

            <h1 class="tit">Poems</h1>
            <div class="para">In 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare published
                two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to
                Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual
                advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful
                Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses,the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result
                from uncontrolled lust.[180] Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime.
                A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a
                persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept
                that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by
                leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the
                deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of
                sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without
                his permission

            <div class="para">
                Published in 1609, the Sonnets were the last of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed. Scholars
                are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that Shakespeare wrote
                sonnets throughout his career for a private readership. Even before the two unauthorised sonnets
                appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim in 1599, Francis Meres had referred in 1598 to Shakespeare's "sugred
                Sonnets among his private friends".[187] Few analysts believe that the published collection follows
                Shakespeare's intended sequence.[188] He seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about
                uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the "dark lady"), and one about conflicted
                love for a fair young man (the "fair youth"). It remains unclear if these figures represent real
                individuals, or if the authorial "I" who addresses them represents Shakespeare himself, though
                Wordsworth believed that with the sonnets "Shakespeare unlocked his heart".[187][186]

                "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
                Thou art more lovely and more temperate ..."

                —Lines from Shakespeare's Sonnet 18.[189]
                The 1609 edition was dedicated to a "Mr. W.H.", credited as "the only begetter" of the poems. It is not
                known whether this was written by Shakespeare himself or by the publisher, Thomas Thorpe, whose initials
                appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who Mr. W.H. was, despite numerous theories,
                or whether Shakespeare even authorised the publication. Critics praise the Sonnets as a profound
                meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time
